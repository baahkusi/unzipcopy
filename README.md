### Problem

I have several zip files each containing files with the same names but different content.

#### Solution

This python script takes as input

1. Directory containing zipped files.
2. Names of files to copy.

It would produce folders using the non extension part of names of files to copy containing those files.

##### Usage

`unzipco.py folder fnames`
